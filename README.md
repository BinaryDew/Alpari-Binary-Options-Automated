# Alpari-Binary-Options-Automated
The program allows to automate binary options trading with Alpari broker. It logs in to Alpari website and opens a websocket connection to their binary trading platform. Then it waits for special files in special folder. When you (or your bot) wants to open a position, you should create a file there with Instrument name, pos size etc. And the position will be opened automatically. You are free to modify the source code to meet your needs. For example, you can make a DLL library and attach tou your external project.
